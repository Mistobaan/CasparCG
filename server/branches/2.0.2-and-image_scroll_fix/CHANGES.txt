CasparCG 2.0 Beta 3 (w.r.t Beta 1)

¤ Formats        
        o ProRes Support            
            + Both encoding and decoding.
            
        o NTSC Support

        o File Consumer added            
            + See updated wiki or ask in forum for more information.

            - Key-only is not supported.
            
        o Bluefish Consumer
            + 24 bit audio support.
            - Embedded-audio does not work with Epoch cards.

            + Use square pixel dimensions.
            
    o AMCP
        + When possible, commands will no longer wait for rendering pipeline. This reduces command execution latencies, especially when sending a lot of commands in a short timespan.

        + Use the same log file for the entire day, instead of one per startup as previously.
        + Diagnostics window is now closable.
    
    o Configuration
        + Simplified.
