CasparCG 2.1.0 (w.r.t 2.0 Stable)
=================================

General
-------

  o 64 bit!
  o Major code refactoring:
    + Mixer abstraction so different implementations can be created. Currently
      CPU mixer and GPU mixer (previously the usage of the GPU was ) exists.
    + Flattened folder structure for easier inclusion of header files.
    + Old Windows specific AsyncEventServer class has been replaced by platform
      independent implementation based on Boost.Asio.
    + Pimpl classes are now stack allocated with internal shared_ptr to
      implementation, instead of both handle and body being dynamically
      allocated. This means that objects are now often passed by value instead
      of via safe_ptr/shared_ptr, because they are internally reference counted.
    + Protocol strategies are now easier to implement correctly, because of
      separation of state between different client connections.
    + Much more...
  o Data files are now stored in UTF-8 with BOM. Latin1 files are still
    supported for backwards compatibility
  o Commands written in UTF-8 to log file but only ascii characters to console.
  o Added supported video formats:
    + 720p2398 (not supported by decklink)
    + 720p2400 (not supported by decklink)
    + 1080p5994
    + 1080p6000
    + 720p30 (not supported by decklink)
    + 720p29.976 (not supported by decklink)

OSC
---

  o Technical information about the current state of the server is published via
    the OSC protocol via different subjects.
  o Examples of information published:
    + Different performance metrics.
    + Producer names
    + Producer specific information
    + Consumer names.
    + Consumer specific information.

CLK
---

  o CLK protocol implementation can now serve more than one connection at a time
    safely.
  o Added timeline support to the CLK protocol.
  o Refactored parts of the CLK parser implementation.

Consumers
---------

  o Consumers on same channel now invoked asynchronously to allow for proper
    sync of multiple consumers.
  o System audio consumer:
    + No longer provides sync to caspar.
    + Pushes data to openal instead of being callbacked by SFML when data is
      needed.
  o Screen consumer:
    + Support for multiple screen consumers on the same channel
    + No longer spin-waits for vsync
    + Now deinterlaces to two separate frames so for example 50i will no longer
      be converted to 25p but instead to 50p for smooth playback of interlaced
      content.

Producers
---------

  o Image scroll producer:
    + Field-rate motion instead of frame-rate motion with interlaced video
      formats. This can be overridden by giving the PROGRESSIVE parameter.
    + SPEED parameter now defines pixels per frame/field instead of half pixels
      per frame. The scrolling direction is also reversed so SPEED 0.5 is the
      previous equivalent of SPEED -1. Movements are done with subpixel accuracy
    + Fixed incorrect starting position of image.
    + Rounding error fixes to allow for more exact scrolling.
    + Added support for motion blur via a new BLUR parameter
    + Added PREMULTIPLY parameter to support images stored with straight alpha.

CasparCG 2.0 Stable (w.r.t Beta 3)
==================================

General

      even crashes.

Consumers
---------

  o File Consumer added
    + See updated wiki or ask in forum for more information.

    + 24 bit audio support.
    - Embedded-audio does not work with Epoch cards.

Producers
---------

      template-host with the corresponding video-mode name is now chosen.
    + Use square pixel dimensions.

AMCP
----

  o When possible, commands will no longer wait for rendering pipeline. This
    reduces command execution latencies, especially when sending a lot of
    commands in a short timespan.
  o Fixed CINF command.
  o ADD/REMOVE no longer require subindex,
    e.g. "ADD 1 SCREEN" / "REMOVE 1 SCREEN" instead of "ADD 1-1 SCREEN" / ...
