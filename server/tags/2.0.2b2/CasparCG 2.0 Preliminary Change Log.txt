Fixes and New Features in CasparCG Server 2.0
===============================================
¤ General:
	o Mayor refactoring for improved readability and mainainability.
	o Some work towards platorm-independence. Currently the greatest challenge for full platform-independence is flash-producer.
	o Misc improved scalability.
	o XML-configuration.
¤ Core:
	o Multiple producers per video_channel.
	o Multiple consumers per video_channel.
	o Swap producers between layers and channels during run-time.
	o Support for upper-field and lower-field interlacing.
	o Add and remove consumers during run-time.
	o Preliminary support for NTSC.
¤ AMCP:
	o Query flash and template-host version.
	o Recursive media-folder listing.
	o Misc changes.
¤ Mixer
	o Animated tween transforms.
¤ Image-Mixer:
	o Fully GPU accelerated (all features listed below are done on the gpu),
	o Layer composition.
	o Colorspaces (rgba, bgra, argb, yuv, yuva, yuv-hd, yuva-hd).
	o Interlacing.
	o Per-layer image-transforms:
		o Opacity
		o Gain
		o Scaling
		o Clipping
		o Translation
¤ Audio-Mixer
	o Per-layer and per-sample audio-transforms:
		o Gain
	o Fully internal audio-mixing. Single output-video_channel.
¤ Decklink
	o Support for multiple decklink-cards.
¤ Decklink-Consumer
	o Embedded audio.
	o HD support.
	o Hardware clock.
¤ Decklink-Producer
	o Embedded audio.
	o HD support.
¤ Bluefish-Consumer
	o Drivers are loaded on-demand (server now runs on computers without installed bluefish-drivers).
	o Embedded-audio.
	o Allocated frames are no longer leaked.
¤ Color-Producer
	o GPU accelerated.
¤ FFMPEG-Consumer
	o Stream CasparCG video-output to file.
¤ FFMPEG-Producer
	o Asynchronous file IO.
	o Parallel decoding of audio and video.
	o Colorspace transform are moved to gpu.
¤ Transition-Producer
	o Fully interlaced transition (previsously only progressive, even when running in interlaced mode).
	o Per-sample mixing between source and destination clips.
	o Tween transitions.
¤ Flash-Producer
	o DirectDraw access (sligthly improved performance).
	o Improved time-sync. Smoother animations and proper interlacing.
¤ Image-Producer
	o Support for various imageformats through FreeImage library.
¤ Diagnostics
	o Graphs for monitoring performance and events.
	o Misc logging improvements.
	o Seperate log-file for every run of the server.
	o Error logging provides full exception details, instead of only printing that an error has occured.
	o Console with real-time logging output.
	o Console with AMCP input.

Deprecated Features
===================
¤ Misc
	o Registry-configuration (replaced by XML-Configuration).
	o TGA-Producer (replaced by Image-Producer).
	o TGA-Scroll-Producer (yet to be replaced).

Known Issues
============
¤ Image-Producer
	o No Image-Scroll-Producer.
¤ Mixer
	o Interlaced ffmpeg media is not scaled properly.
	o Cannot swap between channels with different format-desc.
¤ Transition-Producer
	o No support for vertical transitions.
